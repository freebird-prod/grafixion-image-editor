**Build a modern full-stack web application with two modules — a Photo & Studio App and a Mood-to-Music Generator — using a unique technology stack: the frontend must be Next.js 14 (App Router) styled with ShadCN UI, TailwindCSS, Framer Motion for animations, Radix UI for accessibility, and GSAP for dynamic effects, while the backend should run on Fastify with PostgreSQL as the main database accessed via Prisma ORM, with real-time updates powered by Ably WebSockets, file storage handled by Supabase Storage, authentication through Clerk with both email and OAuth, AI features (image detection, mood analysis, and music generation) powered by HuggingFace models integrated via serverless functions, and deployment split across Vercel for the frontend and Railway for the backend; the application must include a polished landing page with a split hero section showcasing Photo Studio (camera-themed) on the left and Mood-to-Music (music-note-themed) on the right, animated previews, call-to-action buttons, pricing tiers (Free, Pro, Studio Edition), testimonials carousel, Clerk login/register, Stripe-powered subscriptions, and dark/light mode toggle; the Photo & Studio App must support photo uploads via Supabase, applying filters and presets via glfx.js or Fabric.js, face detection and tagging with HuggingFace vision models, a drag-and-drop collage builder workspace with real-time multi-user collaboration via Ably, export to JPEG/PNG, and Prisma schemas for User, Photo, Album, Tag, and EditHistory; the Mood-to-Music Generator must allow users to input mood text or selfies (detected with HuggingFace emotion models), generate matching AI-driven music loops via Riffusion or MusicGen, include a waveform audio player built with Wavesurfer.js, support playlist saving/exporting and public sharing, stream track generation progress live with Ably, and use Prisma schemas for User, MoodInput, GeneratedTrack, and Playlist; globally, the app must be mobile-first responsive, support role-based access for free and paid users, enable social sharing of outputs, integrate Stripe for subscription payments, and demonstrate strong relational database mapping and real-time collaboration across both modules to make it an original, production-ready project useful to the general public while being a showcase of advanced full-stack engineering.
